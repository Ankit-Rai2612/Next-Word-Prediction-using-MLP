# Next-Word-Prediction-using-MLP
I have developed and created a Next Word Prediction model using Multi Layer Prediction.

## Objective 
Developing a next-word prediction model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that accurately predicts the most probable word in a sentence by learning contextual patterns from text data.

## Technology Used
- Programming Language - Python
- Libraries & Frameworks - Tensorflow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy – For tokenization, stop-word removal, and text cleaning.

## Machine Learning / Deep Learning Techniques

- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) – Core neural network model used for next-word prediction.
- Embedding Layer / Word Vectorization – Converts text into numerical vectors.
- One-Hot Encoding / Tokenization – Used to process text input.
- Softmax Output Layer – For predicting the next word from the vocabulary.

## Development Tools
- Google Colab – For writing, training, and testing the model.
